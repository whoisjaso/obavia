/**
 * The printed name on the 130-U's seller line.
 *
 * TxDMV's webDEALER review now rejects a dealer's 130-U whose seller line
 * carries the dealership's name alone. It wants the dealership and, in
 * parentheses, the person at the dealership who handled the sale:
 *
 *     Example Motors LLC (Jordan Rivera)
 *
 * A package came back for exactly this on 30 September 2026. The dealership
 * is the seller; the person in parentheses is its agent, and that is the
 * staff member whose signature goes on the same line. Nothing here is
 * Triple J's: the legal name comes from the dealer config and the agent from
 * the team roster, so every dealer on the platform prints its own.
 *
 * The agent's full legal name is used, never a display name or nickname:
 * this is a state title document.
